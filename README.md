# YOLOv7 Training Guide using the BCCD Dataset

This repository contains a guide notebook on training [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) on custom dataset. Initially, the notebook ran on Google Colab, but should be also possible to run it locally if you set the environment right. In the guide you will see example how to:

* Preprocess the [Public BCCD Dataset](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset) for use in training YOLOv7.
* Adjust and fine-tune the YOLOv7 model to work with your own custom datasets.
* Train the YOLOv7 model on the preprocessed BCCD dataset.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific needs or explore further optimizations. Happy coding!
